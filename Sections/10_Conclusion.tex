\section{Conclusions}

The ground penetrating radar is an underground investigation techniques which give a lot of information about the structure of the subsurface and provide accurate and precise data about the subsurface. The difficult part reside in the interpretation of the data using the geological and stratigraphic as well as the surface indications.

Operating the ground penetrating radar on a steep slope with a lot irregularities is quite challenging to keep a regular survey and is definitely quite exhausting for the person pulling the pulk.

Even with a quite old receiver and transmitter, the quality of the data is still very good even if quite noisy sometimes.

Finally, we confirm the upper sedimentary structure of the area even if we was not able to obtain very accurate information due to the complexity of the interpretation.
